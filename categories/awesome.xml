        “&lt;i&gt;His stories are simple that so many
          people can relate to - the glory of scoring the winning try,
          the
          horror of having a tooth knocked out, the ignominy of having
          to wear
          glasses that looked like they had been cut from the bottom of
          milk
          bottles.&lt;/i&gt; ..." NZ Press Association &lt;br&gt;
