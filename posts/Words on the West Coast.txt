After a recent move to the west coast of New Zealand, I find myself out and about helping the Grey District Library to promote their summer reading challenge. It has been a wonderful opportunity to see more of this fabulous place. It may be wet but well worth a visit.

The beaches don’t have a lot of golden sand, but you can get up close and personal with the local inhabitants.

Even our dog is enjoying the fresh air and open spaces, not to mention cooking over an open fire.

Of course it wouldn’t be the west coast without a waterfall, this is on my way to the foot of the Franz Josef glacier.
