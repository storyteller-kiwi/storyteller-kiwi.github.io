Woke up this morning to the house rattling and rolling. At first I wondered what Liz was doing downstairs, as the shaking continued I realised we were in the middle of an earthquake. Another of the joys of living in New Zealand. Apparently there were a few tremors around the centre of the South Island, I have marked them approximately with pink dots on the map. As you can see they were close enough to be felt here in Greymouth.
