Of course you can watch “Game of Thrones” if you want to see a wall of ice, but no TV screen nor photo quite catches the majesty of the real thing. 

Clouds are a real feature of life on the West Coast of NZ. Moody and beautiful clouds float through your life obscuring mountains and forests but creating their own mystical landscape and then occasionally they lift to reveal just how spectacular the obscured scenery really is.

If you ever get a chance don’t miss the Glaciers of NZ.
