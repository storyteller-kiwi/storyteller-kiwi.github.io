I am lucky enough to find myself performing in Chile over the Easter period and subsequent weeks. 

To be honest I expected more religious processions and passion around Easter, instead it was the dogs here in Santiago that showed me the way to spend Easter. The street dogs of Santiago can be found all around the city and have real character. Here is one reminding us it is always good to take a break over Easter.

Of course not all of us manage to rest over Easter, and this poor dog was busy guarding the parliamentary library.
