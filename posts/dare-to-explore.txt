I have spent the last week largely performing for the Auckland Public Library Summer Reading Programme – Dare to Explore. The Auckland libraries have been fabulous hosts and there have been many highlights.

It is always a pleasure to visit Auckland, and to see their summer reading programme going from strength to strength. Many of my performances were to large crowds of parents and children, it was so fabulous to see families enjoying reading and enjoying their libraries.
