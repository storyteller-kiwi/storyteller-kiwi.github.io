   :alt: Building of Blog

In education and life we often talk about building blocks. The foundations on which we base our decisions and our judgements. The things that make us who we are. In building this blog I had to make a number of decisions, perhaps the most important being whether I had the time to write, and something to write about.

There are a number of blogs about storytelling and about travel, in this sense my blog is not unique, yet I hope it will offer some unique insights into both.

Decisions about the technical aspects of this blog are not yet completed and I hope you will see it develop over the following months.

My first big tour is Chile during April and May 2014 and I hope that I will be able to send you many blog posts.
