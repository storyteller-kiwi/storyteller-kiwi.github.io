And I don't mean the right to roll up your shirt sleeves. 

This was a recent visit to the Royal Armouries in Leeds, United Kingdom. It is well worth a visit and has the added advantage of being free. 

It was also a chance for me to re-visit some of the Medieval stories that I tell and realise the importance of the Medieval period in forming English and European culture. I came away with a fresh perspective on King Arthur and a desire to re-tell many of the stories that I hadn't told in recent years, in particular the 'Marriage of Sir Gawain' or 'The Hag Ragnell'. I look forward to telling it to you some time.
