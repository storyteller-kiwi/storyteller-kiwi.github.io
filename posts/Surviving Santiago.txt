I have survived my first week in Santiago, my voice is a little rough around the edges and my body is feeling the toll of some rigorous performances, but the audience reaction has been worth it. 

The audiences here in Santiago have been full of life and energy making the work of storytelling so much more pleasurable. You can see the reactions for yourself in the following photos from young to old the audiences have embraced the fun of stories.
