I recently had the pleasure of running a series of workshops at Tranby school in Perth. It was a delightful time and some wonderful stories grew out of the experience. I especially loved the story of building a castle out of bricks on the neighbours trampoline, you dont need much imagination to work out what happened next.

Here is a photo from the workshops
