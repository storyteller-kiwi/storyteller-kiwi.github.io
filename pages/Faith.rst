**Why Religious Themed Stories**

Andy often states that one of the inspirations for becoming a storyteller is the gospel of St John, and the "word becomes flesh". Before the modern age of books, stories of our faith were flesh and blood, they lived and grew with us, guiding us on our life journey towards God. To experience the stories of our faith in such a way is a powerful and meaningful experience.

Childhood, and religious experiences form a rich part of the stories professional story teller Andy Wright tells to audiences around the world. “Alas!”, the story teller says “nasty things happen in life, not everyone lives happily ever after”. We see the microcosm of life experiences reflected in Religious stories, take the story of King David, and you see, all the human frailties encapsulated in one man, who still manages to have a loving relationship with God”.

Andrew’s stories are a celebration of the faithful life, the difficulties and joys of our spiritual odyssey. Able to paint pictures with his words, Andrew takes us on a pilgrimage joining a world of Saints, Spiritual Heroes, and personal redemption stories, leading us on our own journey towards the centre of God.
