Andy uses his storytelling to promote literacy, reading, and the love of literature. Most importantly he portrays a sense of fun, mixing a fine blend of humour with true emotional pathos.

For teenagers and adults, Andy performs a variety of horror stories, guaranteed to please and scare.

For pre-schoolers and junior schools, Andy has a number of participatory stories, including chanting, singing, body movement, and theatre sport type activities.

For students above year 4 and throughout tertiary Andy offers a series of workshops on story-telling and writing.
