For <a href="Community.html">community
groups</a> we offer a number of stories for adults and children,
including some personal narratives which are similar to stand up
comedy but with extra pathos. We also offer stories from many of the
<a href="Faith.html">major religions and their holy men and women</a>.

<br/>
<a href="recordings.html">Andy Wright is the company's

Andy is committed to
helping children, adults, and organisations communicate better,
discover their own stories, celebrate their own culture and the
culture of others. <br/>
<br/>
â€œHis stories are simple that so many
people can relate to - the glory of scoring the winning try, the
horror of having a tooth knocked out, the ignominy of having to wear
glasses that looked like they had been cut from the bottom of milk
bottles. ...&quot; NZ Press Association <br/>
